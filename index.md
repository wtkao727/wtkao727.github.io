## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at National Taiwan University, advised by [Chee-Chun Leung (梁次震)](https://www.theplan.it/eng/award-2020-Education/ntu-chee-chun-leung-cosmology-hall-a-floating-cube-in-space-kris-yao-artech).
Before coming to NTU I studied math at the [University of Washington](http://math.washington.edu/).

I study equations of the form $\int_0^\infty e^{-2\pi x^2} \, dx$.
I am also interested in the  groups \\(H_k(\mathcal M_g, \mathbb Q)\\) and 
$\pi_k(\mathrm{Sym}^\infty \mathcal M^\mathrm{trop}_g)$.


## Research Interests

- **Tropical geometry:** curves and Jacobians, Weierstrass points
- **Number theory:** uniform bounds on rational points, Riemann hypothesis
- **Biology:** evolution of bats

## Teaching

I have experience teaching the fundamental theorem of calculus
\\[ \int_a^b f'(x) \, dx = f(b) - f(a) .\\]
This is related to the isomorphism
$\mathrm{Pic}^0(X) \cong H^0(X, \Omega^1)^\vee / H_1(X, \mathbb Z)$
when $X$ is an algebraic curve.
